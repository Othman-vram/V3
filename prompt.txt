I am building a PyQt6 application to manipulate ‚Äútissue fragments‚Äù on a canvas. I need you to implement a group selection and transformation tool. Follow the instructions strictly to avoid UI clutter or bugs.

‚úÖ Features to Implement:
1. Group Selection via Rectangle Tool
Add a tool that allows users to click and drag a rectangle to select multiple fragments on the canvas.

Any fragment intersecting or inside the rectangle should become part of the group selection.

Do not add any new buttons or widgets ‚Äî this tool must be accessed only through a new option in the Menu Bar (e.g., under a "Tools" or "Edit" menu).

Use the existing selection logic and tools already in the application.

2. Group Movement (Preserve Relative Positions)
When any selected fragment is dragged, the entire group should move together.

The relative positions of all fragments in the group must stay exactly the same during the move.

3. Group Rotation (90¬∞ only, around group center)
When multiple fragments are selected, the following must apply:

Only 90¬∞ clockwise (‚Üª) and 90¬∞ counterclockwise (‚Ü∫) rotation buttons should be enabled.

Disable 45¬∞ and free/custom rotation options while a group is selected.

Compute the geometric center (centroid) of the group.

Rotate all fragments as one rigid unit around that center, preserving their layout and spacing.

‚ùóImportant Constraints:
Do NOT add any new buttons, dock widgets, sliders, or controls to the UI.

Only use the Menu Bar to add the new selection tool option.

The selection and rotation behavior for groups must reuse existing UI/controls already present in the app.

Group transformations must be implemented carefully to avoid misalignment or drift between fragments.

üí° Example Clarification:
If I select 3 fragments forming a triangle and rotate them 90¬∞, the entire triangle shape should rotate, maintaining the exact spacing and arrangement ‚Äî not rotating fragments independently.

Auto-zoom: After selecting a group with the rectangle tool, automatically zoom to fit all selected fragments in view.

Real-time updates: Make sure all changes show immediately without needing to click anywhere.

Use existing transform buttons: The same rotation buttons in the control panel should work for both single fragments and groups.

Key Point:
Group rotation = rotate the entire group as if it's one solid object around the group's center point. The fragments should move to new positions while maintaining their relative arrangement.

Don't break any existing functionality and don't clutter the UI with extra widgets.



Fix the UI update bug - Right now when I use arrow buttons, delete fragments, or change opacity, nothing happens on screen until I click somewhere. Make all changes show up immediately.
